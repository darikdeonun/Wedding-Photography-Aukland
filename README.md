# Wedding Photography Aukland
Illustrative [wedding photography aukland](https://dreamlife.co.nz/) is a good mix of traditional and photojournalistic photography styles. The shots are planned in a way that it looks candid while keeping the whole traditional essence of love and romance. Weddings are usually at least 8 hours of shooting, commonly jump up to 14, and can get crazy at 21 hours (which was our longest day ever). That time requires pretty much continual mental and physical effort, as you are following the bride and groom around, documenting their experiences. In photography, style translates into the manner in which we tend to compose, shoot and process our photographs. So, is style nothing more than a pattern? Do we choose our own style or does it come about through the influence of other popular photography styles that we happen to encounter.
